<h1> Hello there! I'm Laura, a curious beginner programmer student 😊 </h2>

<h2> 💬 About me </h2>
<p> My immersion in coding started during the pandemic, as I started studying <b>System Analysis and Development</b> here in Brasil, at the Instituto Federal de São Paulo (IFSP). I'm a graphic design lover, and I also illustrate digitally. 💌 </p>

<h3> 📕 What am I currently learning? </h3>
<p> I'm currently learning <b>C language</b> and Front-End development: <b>Javascript, HTML, CSS and Ajax,</b> but I've studied <b>Python</b> before and I intend to keep studying it. </p>

<h4> 🍒 What languages do I speak? </h4>
<p> I'm brazilian, meaning that my main language is Brazilian Portuguese. However, I also speak English and a little bit of Spanish. </p>
